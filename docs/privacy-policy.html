    </div>

    <div class="container">
        <p class="updated">Last Updated: February 2026</p>

        <p>Ledgeteer ("the App") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our App.</p>

        <h2>1. Data Collection</h2>
        <p>We do <strong>NOT</strong> collect any personal data. The App operates entirely offline and locally on your device. Specifically:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>No personal information is collected, stored, or transmitted to external servers.</li>
            <li>No analytics or tracking tools are used.</li>
            <li>No cookies or similar technologies are used.</li>
            <li>No user accounts are created on our servers.</li>
            <li>No advertising SDKs or third-party tracking is integrated.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. Local Data Storage</h2>
        <p>All data you enter into the App, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Expense transactions (amounts, dates, categories, notes)</li>
            <li>Receipt photos</li>
            <li>App settings and preferences</li>
            <li>Custom categories</li>
        </ul>
        <p>is stored exclusively on your device using a local SQLite database and local file storage. This data never leaves your device unless you explicitly choose to export it.</p>

        <h2>3. Data Export</h2>
        <p>When you use the export feature, data is exported to your device's local storage (Downloads folder). Sharing exported files is entirely at your discretion and under your control. We have no access to exported files.</p>

        <h2>4. Receipt Photos</h2>
        <p>Receipt photos captured or imported through the App are stored locally on your device. These images are not uploaded to any server or cloud service. They remain on your device until you delete them.</p>

        <h2>5. In-App Purchases</h2>
        <p>Premium feature purchases are processed entirely through the Google Play Store or Apple App Store. We do not collect or store any payment information. Purchase verification is handled through the respective store's billing APIs, which only confirm purchase status without sharing your payment details with us.</p>

        <h2>6. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>The App does not integrate with any third-party analytics, advertising, or data collection services. The only third-party interaction is with the app store for in-app purchase verification.</p>

        <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>The App does not knowingly collect any information from children under the age of 13. The App is designed for adults managing personal or business finances.</p>

        <h2>8. Data Security</h2>
        <p>Since all data is stored locally on your device, data security depends on your device's security measures (screen lock, encryption, etc.). We recommend:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Keeping your device secured with a screen lock.</li>
            <li>Regularly backing up your data through the export feature.</li>
            <li>Being cautious when sharing exported files.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>9. Data Deletion</h2>
        <p>You can delete all App data at any time by:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Deleting individual transactions within the App.</li>
            <li>Clearing the App's data through your device settings.</li>
            <li>Uninstalling the App (this removes all local data).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>10. Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in the "Last Updated" date above. Continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.</p>

        <h2>11. Your Rights</h2>
        <p>You have full control over your data at all times since it is stored locally. You can view, modify, export, or delete your data at any time without restriction.</p>

        <h2>12. Contact</h2>
        <p>For questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us through the app store listing.</p>
